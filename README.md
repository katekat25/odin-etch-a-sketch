# odin-etch-a-sketch
This has been the most fun project I've done so far, and I'm very proud of how I've done. I definitely learned to simplify things in this project, as I started with some ideas of how to implement things that were outside the scope of what we've been taught and were causing me headaches. There were some performance issues on my Linux virtual box, but I'm sure they will be minimal in a regular desktop environment. Here are some skills I've demonstrated in this project:

* DOM manipulation

* Adding event listeners

* Writing lots of unique functions with easily understandable names (hopefully?)

* Looping functions

That is all for now. Bye!
